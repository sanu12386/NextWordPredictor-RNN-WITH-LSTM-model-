-:**Next Word Prediction using RNN & LSTM**:-

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the next word in a sequence using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM layers and word embeddings. The model is trained on a dataset of sentences and can be used to predict the next word given an input sequence of words.
